    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>
            â€‹Sean & Jo have been together for over ten years and have shared many bottles of wine and craft beers. Through their love of flavors came the idea of Tipsy Cactus. After a few years of planning and searching, they found the perfect location at Plaza de Fiesta in Mesa, Arizona.  The dream of opening up a taproom and bottle shop became a reality once the lease was signed and construction of the space began. Sean & Jo's idea of sharing their love of delicious wines and beers at an affordable price is now a reality. They look forward to meeting their local neighbors along with the travelers from around the world.
